# Baltimore-CrimeData-Analysis
 

Problem Statement: The Bal(more City Police Department needs an analysis of crime rates in Bal(more from 2017 to 2022. The focus is on overall crime rate changes and identifying the top 5 Neighborhoods with the highest increase and reduc(on in violent crimes, specifically Homicides, Shoo(ngs, Agg. Assaults.


Data Source and Preprocessing: I sourced my data from the Bal(more City Police Department website, covering the years 2011 onwards. To align with our project scope, I refined the dataset to encompass the years 2017 to 2022. Focusing solely on three specific crime types, I conducted a targeted filter to streamline the data. Additionally, I reformaLed the 'crimedatetime' column and introduced a new 'year' column for more efficient analysis. Ensuring data integrity, I removed records with missing values. To maintain consistency, neighborhood names were standardized by conver(ng all characters to uppercase.


Objectives & Results:

1. Overall Change of Crime Rate in Bal(more City : 4.88%.
   
2. Top5 Neighborhood in Highest Increase in Violent Crime: [DOWNTOWN, SANDTOWN-WINCHESTER, BROOKLYN, FRANKFORD, BELAIR-EDISON]
   
3. Top5 Neighborhood in Greatest Decrease in Violent Crime: [LAKE EVESHAM,LOYOLA/NOTREDAME, PORT COVINGTON, VILLAGES OF HOMELAND, CEDARCROFT]

4. I have used multiple hypothesis testings to interpret the results.

5. Created multiple visualization like year wise count and overall change in percentage of crime in baltimore city.
